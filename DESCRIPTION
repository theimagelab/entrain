Description: Entrain is an R package for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. The purpose of Entrain is to predict how the cellular environment shapes cellular differentiation, and quantify the relative contribution of cell-cell communication versus cell-intrinsic mechanisms towards cell fate specification. If you have a dataset of cells that lie along a differentiation trajectory, and/or exhibit robust RNA velocity dynamics, then Entrain will help you generate hypotheses for identifying the environmental signals that are driving your observed dynamics.
