# Entrain ligand-velocity analysis from an Anndata object. 

This document outlines a basic Entrain analysis starting from an `scverse` `anndata` object with pre-calculated velocities. By the end of this document, you will identify ligands that are driving the velocities in your data.

**Prior assumptions:**
Entrain-Velocity Analysis requires the following:

1. Single-Cell RNA data on a dataset of cells differentiating as well as data on their microenvironmental niche. The niche can be contained in a separate dataset (e.g., if you have sequenced in a separate capture) or in the same dataset as the differentiating cells.
2. A `.h5ad` object produced by scvelo that contains robust velocity data. Please ensure that your biology you are interested in is conducive to [producing trustworthy velocities.](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110282).
3. You have (some) idea of which cell clusters comprise the 'niche', or ligand-expressing cells, in your dataset. 


```{r Libraries, results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("Seurat"); library("SeuratWrappers");library("reticulate"); library("dplyr"), library("circlize")
library("entrain")
```
```{r Libraries show, results='hide', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("Seurat"); library("SeuratWrappers");library("reticulate"); library("dplyr"); suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(circlize))
devtools::load_all()
```


## Pre-processing and loading required data.

### Conda setup.
Because RNA velocity is natively done in python, this workflow involves calling python scripts from R to process the anndata object. The interfacing between python and R is handled by the package `reticulate`. We recommend using conda to setup a python environment that contains the required packages for velocity analysis.
```{r Conda, results='hide'}
# reticulate::conda_create("r-reticulate-sc")
# reticulate::conda_install("r-reticulate-sc", packages = c("scanpy", "leidenalg", "python-igraph", "adjustText", "loompy"), channel="conda-forge")
# reticulate::conda_install("r-reticulate-sc", packages = "scvelo", channel="bioconda") 
reticulate::use_condaenv("r-reticulate-sc")  # points to a conda installation that contains scanpy, scvelo, and anndata.
```

### Loading in required data

We will download a developing mouse brain atlas dataset at gestation day 10/11. This dataset contains both RNA expression and RNA velocities needed for our analysis. The following code block downloads the .gz file, decompresses it, and converts it into a Seurat object for analysis.
```{r Read dataset, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE,results='hide'}
library("SeuratDisk")
options(timeout=3600)
h5ad_path <- "Manno_E10_E11.h5ad"
download.file("https://zenodo.org/record/7340143/files/Manno_E10_E11_velocities.h5ad.gz", "Manno_E10_E11_velocities.h5ad.gz")
system("gunzip Manno_E10_E11_velocities.h5ad.gz")
Convert("Manno_E10_E11_velocities.h5ad", dest = "h5seurat", overwrite = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
obj <- LoadH5Seurat("Manno_E10_E11_velocities.h5seurat", assays="RNA")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
obj_v <- readRDS("../../entrain_vignette_data/manno_entrain.rds")
```

Entrain relies on the NicheNet database of ligand-receptor-gene networks for the prior knowledge needed to make conclusions about environmentally-influenced trajectories.
The genes here have been pre-converted from the original human genes to mouse orthologs.
```{r Read NicheNet show, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
lr_network_mm <- readRDS(url("https://zenodo.org/record/7340143/files/lr_network_mm.rds")) #
ligand_target_matrix_mm <- readRDS(url("https://zenodo.org/record/7340143/files/ligand_target_matrix_mm.rds"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ligand_target_matrix_mm <- readRDS("../../entrain_vignette_data/ligand_target_matrix_mm.rds")
lr_network_mm <- readRDS("../../entrain_vignette_data/lr_network_mm.rds")
```

### Data at a glance
The data consists of cells in the developing mouse brain at day 10 after gestation. This comprises a population of neuroblasts rapidly differentiating to neurons (our cells we are going to analyse), as well as their complex microenvironment made up of cells from the endoderm, mesoderm, fibroblastic, blood, and immune compartments.
```{r Dataset at a glance show, eval=FALSE}
n_clusters <- obj@meta.data$Class %>% unique() %>% length()
cols = Seurat::DiscretePalette(n = n_clusters, palette = "alphabet2")
DimPlot(obj, group.by = "Class", cols=cols)
```
```{r Dataset at a glance, echo=FALSE, results='show'}
n_clusters <- obj_v@meta.data$Class %>% unique() %>% length()
cols = Seurat::DiscretePalette(n = n_clusters, palette = "alphabet2")
DimPlot(obj_v, group.by = "Class", cols=cols)
```

## Run Entrain from a velocity anndata object.
Entrain fully integrates the scvelo package for velocity analysis. Below are the main steps:

### Clustering Velocities
1. First, cluster velocities into groups of similar velocity dynamics. The resultant velocity clusters (or `vclusters`) are a separate entity from the usual cell annotation clusters. Cells of the same celltype cluster may not necessarily be in the same velocity cluster.

``` {r Cluster velocities and visualize the major differentiation patterns, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
adata <- entrain_cluster_velocities(h5ad_path, resolution=0.1)
```
``` {r Cluster velocities show, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/entrain_velocity_clusters.png")
```

We can see that the velocity clusters roughly, but not exactly, correspond to cell type clusters, indicating that velocities are moderately correlated with cell type.

### Fitting Ligands to Velocities
The fitting is encapsulated in the single function `entrain_velocity()`, shown below. This function firstly runs  `scvelo.tl.recover_dynamics()` to rank genes based on their fit-likelihoods, a measure of a gene's fit to the ordinary differential equation models that underlie RNA velocity derivation. Higher values denote more confidence in the velocity. Next, it runs Entrain analysis on the velocity likelihoods on a cluster-by-cluster basis.

We will also save the resulting .h5ad object for plotting our results afterwards.
```{r Run Entrain velocity, results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sender_cluster_names <- c("Blood", "Fibroblast", "Immune", "Mesoderm")
Idents(obj) <- "Class"
save_adata =  "../../entrain_vignette_data/manno_entrain_result.h5ad"
obj_v <- entrain_velocity(receiver_obj = obj,
                          adata = adata,
                          save_adata = save_adata,
                          sender_cluster_key = "Class",
                          sender_clusters = sender_cluster_names,
                          lr_network = lr_network_mm,
                          ligand_target_matrix = ligand_target_matrix_mm)
```
## Visualizing results

### At a glance
We can visualize the top ranked ligands at a glance with the function `plot_velocity_ligands()`. By default, the function only visualizes results with positive variance explained, with the assumption that negative variance explained denotes poor model accuracy.

``` {r Plot velocity, eval=FALSE}
plot_velocity_ligands(adata=save_adata,
                      plot_output_path = "manno_entrain.png")

```

```{r Plot results, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/manno_entrain.png")
```
This suggests a number of ligands responsible for neurogenic differentiation processes. These are well-established in literature as key drivers for cell differentiation.

### In detail
Entrain-Velocity provides detailed plotting functions for visualizing extracellular and intracellular regulation predicted to be driving the observed velocities.

#### Sender Cell Visualization
Visualization of cells that express the ligands found in our analysis. Cells are coloured based on mean expression of the `top_n_ligands` predicted to be driving velocities in the velocity cluster. 
```{r Sender influence show, eval=FALSE}
vclusters_to_plot <- c("vcluster0", "vcluster1", "vcluster2", "vcluster3")
save_adata =  "../../entrain_vignette_data/manno_entrain.h5ad"
plot_sender_influence_velocity(adata= save_adata,
                                   velocity_clusters = vclusters_to_plot,
                                   title = "velocity_sender_influences.png")
```


```{r Sender influence, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/entrain_velocity_influence.png")
```
#### Visualizing ligand importances
Visualization of ligands and their relative importances, or contribution, towards each `vcluster`.
```{r Importances heatmap, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
g<-velocity_ligand_importance_heatmap(obj_v,
                                     n_top_ligands=5)
g
```

#### Visualizing high velocity likelihood genes
Commonly, a small proportion of the total genes contribute the majority of the observed RNA velocity dynamics. You may wish to visualize these genes by plotting the top likelihood genes. These genes are the ones found by `scvelo` to most robustly fit the underlying theoretical model. The function `plot_velocity_likelihoods_heatmap()` plots, as a heatmap, the `n_top_genes` ranked by velocity likelihood for each velocity cluster. 
```{r Likelihood heatmap, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
g<-plot_velocity_likelihoods_heatmap(obj_v,
                                     n_top_genes=5)
g
```

A good sanity check is to confirm that the top genes are what we would expect from the biological system. In this case,  FEDSFSDFSD

#### Visualizing intracellular regulation downstream of the ligand-receptor pair.
The function `plot_velocity_ligand_targets` extracts regulatory information from `NicheNetR` to visualize the predicted regulatory linkages between the `n_top_ligands` and the `n_top_targets` high velocity likelihood genes. 
```{r Ligand Targets, eval=FALSE}
g<-plot_velocity_ligand_targets(obj_v, vcluster="vcluster1", n_top_ligands=10L, ligand_target_matrix=ligand_target_matrix_mm)
g
```
```{r Ligand Targets show, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/velocity_targets.png")
```

#### Circos plot
``` {r Circos, eval=FALSE}
weighted_networks <- readRDS(url("https://zenodo.org/record/7233173/files/weighted_networks_mm.rds"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
weighted_networks <- readRDS("../../entrain_vignette_data/weighted_networks_mm.rds")
```

``` {r show plot, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
draw_entrain_circos(obj = obj_v,
                    vcluster= "vcluster3",
                    lr_network = lr_network_mm,
                    weighted_networks = weighted_networks)

```
